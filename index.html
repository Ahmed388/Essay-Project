         ?” “Yes.”</h3>

      <article>
        <p>I have always been tall, decidedly tall. Yet, my curiosity has always surpassed my height. Starting at a young age, I would ask countless questions, from “How heavy is the Earth?” to “Where does rain come from?” My curiosity, displayed in questions like these, has truly defined me as a person and as a student. Therefore, it is not surprising that I became transfixed the first time I played 20Q <a href="https://i.pinimg.com/originals/3f/54/2c/3f542ce97947916a735bd3d9321f3417.jpg" target="_blank">(the electronic version of Twenty Questions).</a>
          Somehow, a little spherical device guessed what I was thinking. The piece of technology sparked my curiosity and instilled in me a unique interest in 20Q. This interest would later reveal valuable character traits of mine while also paralleling various facets of my life..</p>

      <h3>“Does it strive to learn?” “Yes.”</h3>
      <article>
        <p>I became determined to discover how 20Q guessed correctly. After some research, I discovered LINK SOURCE: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence" target="_blank">(Artifical Intelligence).</a> more specifically,  <a href="https://www.google.ca/search?q=artificial+neural&rlz=1C1GCEA_enCA813CA813&oq=artificial+neural&aqs=chrome..69i57j0l5.879j0j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8" target="_blank">(Artifical neural netword-systems)</a> which learn and improve themselves. This idea fascinated me. I wanted to learn more. I read avidly, seeking and absorbing as much information as I could. When given the opportunity years later, I signed up for the first computer programming class available to me. I found myself in an environment I loved. I would stay after class, go in during free periods, make my own apps, and work over LINK SOURCE: <a href="https://www.google.ca/search?safe=strict&rlz=1C1GCEA_enCA813CA813&ei=dwGpW96vDobA0PEPsMeWwA8&q=cloud+based+ide&oq=Cloud+based+IDE&gs_l=psy-ab.3.0.0l5j0i22i30k1l5.186094.189086.0.190409.17.14.1.2.2.0.100.1073.13j1.14.0....0...1c.1.64.psy-ab..0.17.1078...0i67k1j0i131k1j0i131i67k1j0i10k1.0.Bw9BpGAVwQs" target="_blank">(Cloud Based IDE's).</a> I prized the freedom and the possibilities.</p>

      <h3>“Is it driven?” “Yes.”</h3>
      <article>
        <p>After my introduction to 20Q, I began to play Twenty Questions (the traditional parlor game) and became determined to rival the guessing accuracy of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence" target="_blank">(Artifical Intelligence).</a> At first I was mediocre. However, through long car rides with family, good-natured yet heated competitions with friends, logical strategy, and time, I became more effective. I discovered the “secrets” to success: practice and perseverance.</p>
      </article>
      <h3>"Does it apply when it learns?""Yes."</h3>
      <article>
        <p>As 20Q implements what it learns, so do I. Throughout high school, I applied the “secret” of practice to my basketball career. I spent countless hours sharpening my skills in 90° summer heat to 20° late-winter cold, countless afternoons playing pickup games with my friends, and countless weekends traveling to AAU basketball tournaments. As a result, I became a starter for my school’s <a href="https://www.google.ca/search?q=varsity+team&safe=strict&rlz=1C1GCEA_enCA813CA813&source=lnms&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjHm4fm-9PdAhUCx58KHW09BhsQ_AUICSgA&biw=1536&bih=723&dpr=1.25" target="_blank">(Varsity Team).</a> I applied another “secret,” this time the “secret” of perseverance, by dedicating myself to physical therapy after knee surgery in order to quickly return to football. Later that year, I became the first player in my grade to score a varsity touchdown.</p>
